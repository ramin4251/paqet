`paqet` is a bidirectional packet level proxy built using raw sockets. It forwards traffic from a local client to a remote server, bypassing the host operating system's TCP/IP stack, using KCP for secure, reliable transport.

> **⚠️ Development Status Notice**
>
> This project is in **active development**. APIs, configuration formats, and interfaces may change without notice. Use with caution in production environments.

## How It Works

`paqet` captures packets using `pcap` and injects crafted TCP packets containing encrypted transport data. KCP provides reliable, encrypted communication optimized for high-loss networks using aggressive retransmission, forward error correction, and symmetric encryption.

```
[Your App] <------> [paqet Client] <===== Raw TCP Packet =====> [paqet Server] <------> [Target Server]
(e.g. curl)        (localhost:1080)        (Internet)          (Public IP:PORT)     (e.g. https://httpbin.org)
```

`paqet` use cases include bypassing firewalls that detect standard handshake protocols and kernel-level connection tracking, as well as network security research. While more complex to configure than general-purpose VPN solutions, it offers granular control at the packet level.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `libpcap` development libraries must be installed on both the client and server machines.
  - **Linux:** No prerequisites - binaries are statically linked.
  - **macOS:** Comes pre-installed with Xcode Command Line Tools. Install with `xcode-select --install`
  - **Windows:** Install Npcap. Download from [npcap.com](https://npcap.com/).

### 1. Download a Release

Download the pre-compiled binary for your client and server operating systems from the [Releases page](https://github.com/hanselime/paqet/releases/latest).

### 2. Configure the Connection

#### Finding Your Network Details

You'll need to find your network interface name, local IP, and the MAC address of your network's gateway (router).

**On Linux:**

1.  **Find Interface and Local IP:** Run `ip a`. Look for your primary network card (e.g., `eth0`, `ens3`). Its IP address is listed under `inet`.
2.  **Find Gateway MAC:**
    - First, find your gateway's IP: `ip r | grep default`
    - Then, find its MAC address with `arp -n <gateway_ip>` (e.g., `arp -n 192.168.1.1`).

**On macOS:**

1.  **Find Interface and Local IP:** Run `ifconfig`. Look for your primary interface (e.g., `en0`). Its IP is listed under `inet`.
2.  **Find Gateway MAC:**
    - First, find your gateway's IP: `netstat -rn | grep default`
    - Then, find its MAC address with `arp -n <gateway_ip>` (e.g., `arp -n 192.168.1.1`).

**On Windows:**

1. **Find Interface and Local IP:** Run `ipconfig /all` and note your active network adapter (Ethernet or Wi-Fi):
   - Its **IP Address**
   - The **Gateway IP Address**
2. **Find Interface device GUID:** Windows requires the Npcap device GUID. In PowerShell, run `Get-NetAdapter | Select-Object Name, InterfaceGuid`. Note the **Name** and **InterfaceGuid** of your active network interface, and format the GUID as `\Device\NPF_{GUID}`.
3. **Find Gateway MAC Address:** Run: `arp -a <gateway_ip>`. Note the MAC address for the gateway.

#### Client Configuration - SOCKS5 Proxy Mode

The client acts as a SOCKS5 proxy server, accepting connections from applications and dynamically forwarding them through the raw TCP packets to any destination.

#### Example Client Configuration (`config.yaml`)

```yaml
# Role must be explicitly set
role: "client"

# Logging configuration
log:
  level: "info" # none, debug, info, warn, error, fatal

# SOCKS5 proxy configuration (client mode)
socks5:
  - listen: "127.0.0.1:1080" # SOCKS5 proxy listen address

# Port forwarding configuration (can be used alongside SOCKS5)
# forward:
#   - listen: "127.0.0.1:8080"  # Local port to listen on
#     target: "127.0.0.1:80"    # Target to forward to (via server)
#     protocol: "tcp"           # Protocol (tcp/udp)

# Network interface settings
network:
  interface: "en0" # CHANGE ME: Network interface (en0, eth0, wlan0, etc.)
  # guid: "\Device\NPF_{...}" # Windows only (Npcap).
  ipv4:
    addr: "192.168.1.100:0" # CHANGE ME: Local IP (use port 0 for random port)
    router_mac: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" # CHANGE ME: Gateway/router MAC address

# Server connection settings
server:
  addr: "10.0.0.100:9999" # CHANGE ME: paqet server address and port

# Transport protocol configuration
transport:
  protocol: "kcp" # Transport protocol (currently only "kcp" supported)
  kcp:
    block: "aes" # Encryption algorithm
    key: "your-secret-key-here" # CHANGE ME: Secret key (must match server)
```

#### Example Server Configuration (`config.yaml`)

```yaml
# Role must be explicitly set
role: "server"

# Logging configuration
log:
  level: "info" # none, debug, info, warn, error, fatal

# Server listen configuration
listen:
  addr: ":9999" # CHANGE ME: Server listen port (must match network.ipv4.addr port), WARNING: Do not use standard ports (80, 443, etc.) as iptables rules can affect outgoing server connections.

# Network interface settings
network:
  interface: "eth0" # CHANGE ME: Network interface (eth0, ens3, en0, etc.)
  ipv4:
    addr: "10.0.0.100:9999" # CHANGE ME: Server IPv4 and port (port must match listen.addr)
    router_mac: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" # CHANGE ME: Gateway/router MAC address

# Transport protocol configuration
transport:
  protocol: "kcp" # Transport protocol (currently only "kcp" supported)
  kcp:
    block: "aes" # Encryption algorithm
    key: "your-secret-key-here" # CHANGE ME: Secret key (must match client)
```

#### Critical Firewall Configuration

Although packets are handled at a low level, the OS kernel can still see incoming packets on the connection port and generate TCP RST packets since it has no knowledge of the connection. These kernel generated resets can corrupt connection state in NAT devices and stateful firewalls, causing instability, packet drops, and premature termination.

You **must** configure `iptables` on the server to prevent the kernel from interfering.

> **⚠️ Important - Avoid Standard Ports**
>
> Do not use ports 80, 443, or any other standard ports, because iptables rules can also affect outgoing connections from the server. Choose non-standard ports (e.g., 9999, 8888, or other high-numbered ports) for your server configuration.

Run these commands as root on your server:

```bash
# Replace <PORT> with your server listen port (e.g., 9999)

# 1. Bypass connection tracking (conntrack) for the connection port. This is essential.
# This tells the kernel's netfilter to ignore packets on this port for state tracking.
sudo iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport <PORT> -j NOTRACK
sudo iptables -t raw -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport <PORT> -j NOTRACK

# 2. Prevent the kernel from sending TCP RST packets that would kill the session.
# This drops any RST packets the kernel tries to send from the connection port.
sudo iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport <PORT> --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP

# An alternative for rule 2 if issues persist:
sudo iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <PORT> -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport <PORT> -j ACCEPT

# To make rules persistent across reboots:
# Debian/Ubuntu: sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
# RHEL/CentOS: sudo service iptables save
```

These rules ensure that only the application handles traffic for the connection port.

### 3. Run `paqet`

Make the downloaded binary executable (`chmod +x ./paqet_linux_amd64`). You will need root privileges to use raw sockets.

**On the Server:**
_Place your server configuration file in the same directory as the binary and run:_

```bash
# Make sure to use the binary name you downloaded for your server's OS/Arch.
sudo ./paqet_linux_amd64 run -c config.yaml
```

**On the Client:**
_Place your client configuration file in the same directory as the binary and run:_

```bash
# Make sure to use the binary name you downloaded for your client's OS/Arch.
sudo ./paqet_darwin_arm64 run -c config.yaml
```

### 4. Test the Connection

Once the client and server are running, test the SOCKS5 proxy:

```bash
# Test with curl using the SOCKS5 proxy
curl -v https://httpbin.org/ip --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080
```

This request will be proxied over raw TCP packets to the server, and then forwarded according to the client mode configuration. The output should show your server's public IP address, confirming the connection is working.

## Command-Line Usage

`paqet` is a multi-command application. The primary command is `run`, which starts the proxy, but several utility commands are included to help with configuration and debugging.

The general syntax is:

```bash
sudo ./paqet <command> [arguments]
```

| Command   | Description                                                                      |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run`     | Starts the `paqet` client or server proxy. This is the main operational command. |
| `secret`  | Generates a new, cryptographically secure secret key.                            |
| `ping`    | Sends a single test packet to the server to verify connectivity .                |
| `dump`    | A diagnostic tool similar to `tcpdump` that captures and decodes packets.        |
| `version` | Prints the application's version information.                                    |

## Configuration Reference

paqet uses unified YAML configuration for client and server. The `role` field must be explicitly set to either `"client"` or `"server"`.

**For complete parameter documentation, see the example files:**

- [`example/client.yaml.example`](example/client.yaml.example) - Client configuration reference
- [`example/server.yaml.example`](example/server.yaml.example) - Server configuration reference

### Encryption Modes

The `transport.kcp.block` parameter determines the encryption method.

⚠️ **Warning:** `none` and `null` modes disable authentication, anyone with your server IP and port can connect.

- **`none`** - Plaintext with protocol header (protocol-compatible)
- **`null`** - Raw data, no header (highest performance, least secure)

### TCP Flag Cycling

The `network.tcp.local_flag` and `network.tcp.remote_flag` arrays cycle through flag combinations to vary traffic patterns. Common patterns: `["PA"]` (standard data), `["S"]` (connection setup), `["A"]` (acknowledgment).

# Architecture & Security Model

### The `pcap` Approach and Firewall Bypass

Understanding why standard firewalls are bypassed is key to using this tool securely.

A normal application uses the OS's TCP/IP stack. When a packet arrives, it travels up the stack where `netfilter` (the backend for `ufw`/`firewalld`) inspects it. If a firewall rule blocks the port, the packet is dropped and never reaches the application.

```
      +------------------------+
      |   Normal Application   |  <-- Data is received here
      +------------------------+
                   ^
      +------------------------+
      |    OS TCP/IP Stack     |  <-- Firewall (netfilter) runs here
      |  (Connection Tracking) |
      +------------------------+
                   ^
      +------------------------+
      |     Network Driver     |
      +------------------------+
```

`paqet` uses `pcap` to hook in at a much lower level. It requests a copy of every packet directly from the network driver, before the main OS TCP/IP stack and firewall get to process it.

```
      +------------------------+
      |    paqet Application   |  <-- Gets a packet copy immediately
      +------------------------+
              ^       \
 (pcap copy) /         \  (Original packet continues up)
            /           v
      +------------------------+
      |     OS TCP/IP Stack    |  <-- Firewall drops the original packet,
      |  (Connection Tracking) |      but paqet already has its copy.
      +------------------------+
                  ^
      +------------------------+
      |     Network Driver     |
      +------------------------+
```

This means a rule like `ufw deny <PORT>` will have no effect on the proxy's operation, as `paqet` receives and processes the packet before `ufw` can block it.

## Troubleshooting

1.  **Permission Denied:** Ensure you are running with `sudo`.
2.  **Connection Times Out:**
    - **Transport Configuration Mismatch:**
      - **KCP**: Ensure `transport.kcp.key` is exactly identical on client and server
    - **`iptables` Rules:** Did you apply the firewall rules on the server?
    - **Incorrect Network Details:** Double-check all IPs, MAC addresses, and interface names.
    - **Cloud Provider Firewalls:** Ensure your cloud provider's security group allows TCP traffic on your `listen.addr` port.
    - **NAT/Port Configuration:** For servers, ensure `listen.addr` and `network.ipv4.addr` ports match. For clients, use port `0` in `network.ipv4.addr` for automatic port assignment to avoid conflicts.
3.  **Use `ping` and `dump`:** Use `paqet ping -c config.yaml` to test the connection. Use `paqet dump -p <PORT>` on the server to see if packets are arriving.
